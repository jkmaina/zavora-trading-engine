# Account Service Implementation Status

This document outlines the implementation status and development notes for the Account Service. For user documentation, please refer to the [Account Service README](./account-service/README.md) in the account-service directory.

## What's Implemented

1. **Enhanced Database Schema**
   - Added a proper `balances` table to support multiple assets per account
   - Created appropriate indices for efficient lookups
   - Established relationships between accounts and balances

2. **Repository Layer**
   - Implemented PostgreSQL repository with SQL queries for the new schema
   - Added in-memory repository for testing
   - Added transaction support for atomic operations
   - Implemented balance validation and error handling

3. **Service Layer**
   - Implemented deposit and withdrawal functionality
   - Added support for reserving funds for orders
   - Created process_trade method with transaction support
   - Added balance locks to prevent race conditions

4. **Configuration Management**
   - Added a config module with environment variable support
   - Implemented connection pool configuration
   - Added transaction logging options

5. **Standalone Binary**
   - Created a binary with command-line arguments
   - Added graceful shutdown handling
   - Implemented logging and tracing

6. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Added unit tests for the repository and service layers
   - Created integration tests for trade execution

## Integration Status

The previously identified integration issues have been addressed:

1. **Model Compatibility** ✅
   - Models now match the database schema
   - Field name standardization complete
   - DB queries reference correct fields

2. **SQLx Integration** ✅
   - PostgreSQL repository implementation is complete
   - Offline mode with query cache is available
   - Transaction support is working properly

3. **Async Support** ✅
   - All methods properly use async/await
   - Proper error handling for async operations
   - Thread-safe concurrent access

## Next Steps

For future development:

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Benchmark critical transactions
   - Optimize database queries
   - Implement query caching for common operations

2. **Extended Features**
   - Add user authentication and authorization
   - Implement audit logging for financial operations
   - Add support for transaction history and reporting

3. **Advanced Testing**
   - Add more comprehensive integration tests
   - Implement performance and load tests
   - Add chaos testing for resilience verification

## How to Use the Account Service

The account service can be used as follows:

```rust
// Create a service with configuration
let config = AccountServiceConfig::from_env();
let service = AccountService::with_config(&config).await?;

// Create an account
let account = service.create_account().await?;

// Deposit funds
service.deposit(account.id, "USD", dec!(1000)).await?;

// Get balances
let balances = service.get_balances(account.id).await?;

// Process trades
service.process_trade(&trade).await?;
```

Run the standalone binary:

```bash
cargo run -p account-service -- start --database-url postgres://user:pass@localhost/zavora --db-pool-size 10
```

Or run the entire trading engine with the account service integrated:

```bash
cargo run -p trading-engine -- --demo
```

## Conclusion

The account service implementation provides a robust foundation for managing user balances and processing trades in the Zavora Trading Engine. The service is fully integrated with the rest of the system and ready for use.

Key features implemented:
- Async interface for non-blocking operations
- Support for both in-memory and PostgreSQL repositories
- Transaction safety for financial operations
- Thorough testing infrastructure
