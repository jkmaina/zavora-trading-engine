   - Implemented request IDs for tracing

## Integration Status

The API Gateway has been successfully integrated with other components:

1. **Account Service Integration** ✅
   - Account creation and retrieval
   - Balance management
   - Order funding verification

2. **Matching Engine Integration** ✅
   - Order placement and execution
   - Order cancellation
   - Order book retrieval

3. **Market Data Service Integration** ✅
   - Real-time market data streaming
   - Historical data retrieval
   - Market statistics access

4. **Asynchronous Operations** ✅
   - All methods properly use async/await
   - Non-blocking request handling
   - Proper future handling and error propagation

## Known Issues

1. **Authentication**
   - No user authentication implemented
   - Missing authorization for privileged operations
   - No API key management

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - No request rate limiting
   - Potential for abuse by clients
   - Missing IP-based throttling

3. **Documentation**
   - No OpenAPI/Swagger integration
   - Incomplete endpoint documentation
   - Missing versioning strategy

4. **Performance**
   - No response caching
   - Serialization overhead for large responses
   - No connection pooling optimization

## Next Steps

For future development:

1. **Authentication System**
   - Implement JWT-based authentication
   - Add user roles and permissions
   - Create API key management
   - Implement OAuth2 support

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Add response caching
   - Implement request batching
   - Optimize serialization for large responses
   - Add connection pooling

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Implement GraphQL interface
   - Add request/response compression
   - Create API versioning strategy
   - Implement detailed metrics and monitoring

4. **Documentation**
   - Add OpenAPI/Swagger integration
   - Create interactive API documentation
   - Implement request/response examples
   - Add SDK generation

## How to Use the API Gateway

The API Gateway is fully integrated and can be accessed as follows:

### REST API

```bash
# Create an account
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v1/accounts -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'

# Get market data
curl -X GET http://localhost:8081/api/v1/markets/BTC/USD/ticker

# Place an order
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v1/orders -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "user_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
  "market": "BTC/USD",
  "side": "buy",
  "order_type": "limit",
  "price": "20000",
  "quantity": "0.1"
}'
```

### WebSocket API

```javascript
// Connect to WebSocket
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8081/ws');

// Subscribe to order book updates
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  op: 'subscribe',
  channel: 'orderbook',
  market: 'BTC/USD'
}));

// Handle incoming messages
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log('Received:', data);
};
```

## Conclusion

The API Gateway implementation provides a unified entry point to the Zavora Trading Engine, with RESTful and WebSocket interfaces for clients. It handles request routing, validation, and communication with the internal microservices.

Key strengths:
- Comprehensive REST API
- Real-time WebSocket interface
- Clean error handling
- Standardized response formats with consistent structure
- Efficient service integration

Areas for improvement:
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- API documentation
- Performance optimization
