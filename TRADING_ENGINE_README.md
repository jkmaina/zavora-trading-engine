## How to Run the Trading Engine

The trading engine can be run in different configurations:

### Full System with Demo Data

```bash
# Start the database
docker compose up -d postgres

# Run the trading engine with demo data
cargo run -p trading-engine -- --demo
```

### Individual Services

```bash
# Start the account service
cargo run -p account-service -- start

# Start the API gateway
cargo run -p api-gateway
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run unit tests
cargo test

# Run database tests
source .env.test && cargo test --test db_tests -- --ignored

# Run service tests
cargo test -p account-service
cargo test -p matching-engine
cargo test -p market-data
```

## Error Handling System

The trading engine implements a standardized error handling approach:

### Common Error Types

All services use a common error system defined in `common/error/mod.rs`, which provides:
- Domain-specific error types (e.g., `MarketNotFound`, `InsufficientBalance`, `AccountNotFound`)
- Context utilities with `ErrorExt` trait to add context to errors
- Consistent error conversion through `IntoError` trait
- Comprehensive mapping to HTTP status codes in the API gateway

### Transaction Handling

Database operations use a standardized transaction system:
- `Transaction` trait for consistent transaction operations
- `TransactionManager` trait for creating transactions
- Implementations for both PostgreSQL and in-memory repositories
- Consistent rollback pattern on errors

### Best Practices

When working with the error system:
1. Use the most specific error type possible
2. Add context to errors with `.with_context()`
3. Handle transactions with proper rollback on errors
4. Log errors with appropriate severity levels

## Conclusion
